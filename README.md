# T-Chart-for-Time-Between-Rare-Events-(Exponential-Distribution)-
This project created a T-Chart, a type of control chart, for surveillance of the time between adverse rare events (where the data follow an Exponential distribution). This tool is in the form of a Microsoft Excel workbook.

Note that there is a typographical error in reference 7, specifically the Calculation section, whereby the author explains that you should "Remove any y values where y > 3.27 [MR-Bar]". The term "y" should actually be "MR". Without this change the Centreline, Lower Control Limit, and Upper Control Limit cannot be properly calculated. However, this tool uses the correct notation, which was identified from Reference 2 and can be found on page 203 of that textbook.
